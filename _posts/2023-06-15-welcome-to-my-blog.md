## Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences with you. This blog will primarily focus on programming, technology, and other topics that interest me.

### What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect:

- Tutorials on Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript
- Tips and tricks for web development
- My thoughts on new technologies and frameworks
- Personal projects and learning experiences

### Code Examples

Here's a simple Ruby example:

```ruby
# A simple greeting class in Ruby
class Greeter
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
  
  def greet
    puts "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end

greeter = Greeter.new("World")
greeter.greet  # Outputs: Hello, World!
```

### Markdown Support

Jekyll uses Markdown, which makes it easy to format posts:

- **Bold text** is created with double asterisks
- *Italic text* uses single asterisks
- [Links](https://jekyllrb.com) are created with square brackets and parentheses
- Lists, like this one, are created with dashes
