## Hello World!

Hello! Welcome to my blog. I've been wanting to restart my blog for quite a while now. Most of the time I won't be discussing lengthy subjects or writing comprehensive, in-depth tutorials. Instead, I'll be sharing interesting things I've discovered on the web, my opinions on various topics, and occasionally insights and findings from my work.

### About me

I work at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/careers)! It's the biggest Rails shop in the world, and I absolutely love it. Every single day brings some new discovery, which is awesome! You can learn more about Shopify's open source philosophy [here](https://shopify.engineering/shopify-open-source-philosophy). Join me as we learn more about Ruby and Rails together. :)
