## 5 Ruby Tips and Tricks to Enhance Your Code

Ruby is a language known for its elegance and developer-friendly features. Today, I'll share some of my favorite Ruby tips and tricks that can make your code more concise, readable, and efficient.

### 1. Use the Safe Navigation Operator

The safe navigation operator (`&.`) is a great way to avoid `nil` errors. It's similar to the try method but built into the language.

```ruby
# Instead of this:
user && user.profile && user.profile.name

# You can do this:
user&.profile&.name
```

### 2. One-Line Conditionals

Ruby allows you to write conditionals in a very concise way:

```ruby
# Traditional if statement
if user.admin?
  redirect_to admin_path
end

# One-liner
redirect_to admin_path if user.admin?

# Using unless
return unless valid?
```

### 3. The Splat Operator

The splat operator (`*`) is powerful for working with arrays:

```ruby
# Convert array elements to arguments
def greet(first_name, last_name)
  puts "Hello, #{first_name} #{last_name}!"
end

person = ["John", "Smith"]
greet(*person)  # Outputs: Hello, John Smith!

# Capture remaining arguments
def team(captain, *members)
  puts "Captain: #{captain}"
  puts "Members: #{members.join(', ')}"
end

team("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave")
# Outputs:
# Captain: Alice
# Members: Bob, Charlie, Dave
```

### 4. Using tap for Method Chaining

The `tap` method allows you to perform operations in a method chain without affecting the chain:

```ruby
# Without tap
user = User.new
user.name = "John"
user.email = "john@example.com"
user.save

# With tap
User.new.tap do |u|
  u.name = "John"
  u.email = "john@example.com"
end.save
```

### 5. The `||=` Operator

The `||=` operator (also known as the "or equals" operator) is great for memoization and setting default values:

```ruby
# Set a default value
@cache ||= {}

# Memoization
def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
end
```

### Conclusion

These Ruby tips and tricks can help you write cleaner, more maintainable code. Remember, the best Ruby code often reads almost like plain English, so strive for clarity and elegance in your solutions.
