Which is horrible, I don’t think they add any value and it’s impossible to opt-out.
So, I started digging and seeing how I could make things cheaper so at least from my side, Google would not get all the greenies it wants. Well, one of the tools I decided to use was to find heavy files in my Gmail, Google Photos and Google Drive.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I found a Git bundle of a project I was part of in 2009. It was my first real Ruby project, getting my hands dirty. The project was Sportlog, a community driven by exercises and milestones, very similar to what Strava is nowadays. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out, and the project was closed in 2010.
Curious as I am, I had to see what was there, right now.
So, I ran:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone ~/Downloads/Sportlog.git.bundle
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And to my wonder all the files were there! Like looking into the past:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Mar 17 15:15 Capfile
Mar 17 15:15 README
Mar 17 22:21 Rakefile
Mar 17 15:15 app
Mar 17 21:49 config
Mar 17 15:15 db
Mar 17 15:15 doc
Mar 17 15:15 lang
Mar 17 15:15 lib
Mar 17 21:28 log
Mar 17 21:24 patches
Mar 17 15:15 public
Mar 17 15:15 script
Mar 17 15:15 test
Mar 17 15:15 themes
Mar 17 21:57 tmp
Mar 17 15:15 utils
Mar 17 15:15 vendor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally! So now, how can I run a project from 15 years ago? It will take a long time to upgrade everything, and I will need to do it in steps. From Rails 2, to 3, and then 4 and etc. And in version 3, <a href="https://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/">Ruby on Rails and Merb merged</a>, so it was a <strong>lot</strong> of changes to handle. Impossible.</p>

<p>But nowadays we have a series of tools that can actually make us move to the past and accomplish this: <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>AI</strong>.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I opened Cursor with my project, gave the first instructions and started a battle of instructions that lasted for almost 2 hours. But something was also missing: the database. The migrations were there, but I did not have similar data to work with. Lucky me, in my e-mail was also a copy of the database we used during development (almost 15 years ago we handled everything through e-mails), Dropbox and others were brand new. 
With all that in place, here is my current git status:</p>

<p>The main changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Several monkey patches to support outdated code in libraries dead for a long time. AI shined here.</li>
  <li>Update of locales. Most of this project was written in Brazilian Portuguese, and the encoding at the time was extremely painful. I did several changes to just remove the magic words, for example “Administração” contains 2 encoded characters not common to English language, and I just modified it to be “Administracao”, no special characters, no weird encoding errors.</li>
  <li>For some reason, several helpers were missing. I think Cursor modified something to always expect a non-existing helper, so I had to add several for the pages I navigated.</li>
  <li>Restoring old plugins (think like Engines), had to go through all the versions in an archived project (community_engine) and get the correct Rails version.</li>
  <li>Removing keys and e-mails so I don’t message anyone from my old team <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code> after all, I don’t own this code.</li>
  <li>Fixes and fixes! Several, from a wrong column in the database to weird ASCII characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Btw! This is how we used to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rails console</code> in the past:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker-compose <span class="nb">exec </span>web script/console
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which executes:</p>
<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'../../config/boot'</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="kp">__FILE__</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'commands/console'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And after some time, it was running:
<img src="/assets/images/sportlog1.png" alt="Sportlog Home Page" />
<img src="/assets/images/sportlog2.png" alt="Sportlog Training Panel" /></p>

<p>This is so exciting! So many memories. And so many interesting things! Now, let’s look at the code.</p>

<p>Today we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">refute</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assert</code> on Minitest, in 2009, not quite:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'test_helper'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ExerciseMachineBrandTest</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveSupport</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TestCase</span>

    <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="o">!</span> <span class="n">brand</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">valid?</span>
    <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">brand</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">errors</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    
    <span class="n">brand</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'brand'</span>
    <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="n">brand</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">valid?</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, it was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assert ! object.valid?</code> to verify if it was false? A bit interesting. And I was quite happy to see a lot of functional tests. Which btw, this is the whole tests structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fixtures
functional
integration
javascript
jmeter.jmx
performance
test_helper.rb
unit
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A bit different from what we have today.</p>

<p>Functional tests were not so different from what we have today too:</p>

<p>I can see many differences and many things I would write differently too, but nonetheless, I can easily understand this. And this is the magic Ruby on Rails introduced a long time ago. Ruby is Poetry.</p>

<p>Several things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The lack of space on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class Post&lt;ActiveRecord::Base</code> kills me 😂. First refactor: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base</code>.</li>
  <li>Ruby hash rocket all over the place.</li>
  <li>A lot of inexperienced code too “return”, but in Ruby, every method returns something. That one was my fault!</li>

  <li>A lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define_method</code> for no good reason.</li>
  <li>The font size was very small.</li>
  <li>A lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">form_remote_for</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jQuery</code>, I mean, look at this beauty:</li>

<p>A lot of design ideas missing from this implementation, which makes sense, most of the developers came from Web Agencies and had no knowledge of Design Principles.</p>

<p>Well, this was a very interesting problem. Going to the past and seeing how things worked, deployment techniques, Rack sending e-mails to notify of bugs in production and much more. Glad to see how far we have come!</p>

Including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blog engine with Jekyll (Markdown ❤️)</li>
  <li>Hosting on Github for availability</li>
  <li>CSS inspired by my personal website</li>
  <li>Support to code highlight</li>
  <li>Mapping and SEO revision</li>
  <li>3 Posts (including this one)</li>
  <li>DNS forwarding from blog.leonardopereira.com to dantetekanem.github.io</li>
</ul>

<p>How? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cursor</code> are the answer. The first one needs no introduction, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is an amazing gem that has been around for a long time, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> also provides several ways to easily start a new one. You just need to have a repo of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username/username.github.io</code>.
But without <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, this would have taken me the entire day, or maybe even a couple of days. Instead, using the power of Composer, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking</code> and a few good instructions, it bootstrapped everything, auto-corrected any issues, and provided a perfect first draft.</p>

<p>There was no magic in my commands. I don’t have the exact set of instructions, but it was something like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Let’s bootstrap a new blog using Jekyll, I want it to look like my personal website: leonardopereira.com</li>
  <li>~ Claude started working and got all the gems, ran the commands and more.</li>
  <li>I stopped some of the progress and asked not to use comments right now, as I want to evaluate them better.</li>
  <li>~ In the first debug session, the CSS was not working. I complained and it did some debugging itself and identified that SASS was not working. After a few tries, it decided to use plain CSS (a great choice, actually).</li>
  <li>Added about 10 instructions to get the CSS right the way I wanted it, after navigating and fixing.</li>
  <li>For the posts, I rewrote them using my own voice, and asked to fix any grammar or bad communication, so I could improve the quality of this blog.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yeah, that’s it. Half of the other time was spent pointing the correct DNS on Squarespace and Github.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-takeaways">A few takeaways</h2>

<p>Now this is an interesting post from my side. I had some issues with Cursor in the past. Most of them I’ve fixed with <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai">Rules</a> and learning better ways to use the platform. But the technology is undoubtedly one of the best things we have. Many of my problems fell under one thing: bad engineers.
I have seen many people writing <em>horrible</em> code using AI, deploying to production, calling it a day, and then PagerDuty calling me back explaining everything went down.
AI is not a panacea; it hallucinates constantly. You need to feed it good directions, but more than that. You need to read what’s happening, you need to question whether the code produced makes sense and if it’s actually solving the problem the correct way. Asking for something, starting the server and seeing the results are amazing. But that is not production-ready code. A good engineer needs to write good code, understand design, and use AI for what it is: A fantastic tool to help improve your job.</p>

<p>I had a prejudice against Cursor for a while based on bad experiences. Happily, this is not the case anymore. I am creating a new app with features that otherwise would take me years, and I should have a prototype in the upcoming months, working on it only in my free time.</p>

<h2 id="on-scoping">On scoping</h2>

<p>Another extremely valuable thing to do in order to get the best from AI is: Isolating your scope. I am using ChatGPT heavily for this. I open a new session and give all the context of what I want to accomplish - fix a bug, create a new feature, etc. Later, I provide the files and start iterating with this information. This isolation diminishes the level of hallucinations greatly, helping a lot with fixing issues and <strong>getting shit done</strong>. And again, I review everything. If I don’t know something, I ask the model what it means. It is helping me build something, but I still hold responsibility for everything.</p>

<p>Use AI, improve your game. Take responsibility. <span style="color: #F2C94C;">Happy coding!</span></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="programming" /><category term="ai" /><category term="software development" /><category term="ai" /><category term="cursor" /><category term="10x engineer" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was able to make this blog from zero to production in 1 hour.

It’s a bit aggressive and harsh, but nonetheless it’s worth reading! They go through 3 main topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Refactoring and small methods vs longer methods.</li>
  <li>Comments, useful or not?</li>
  <li>TDD.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to discuss the second and third topics, but in this post I’ll focus on the second one: <em>Comments!</em></p>

<p>My opinion is that comments should give a piece of history or story around why a decision was made. I don’t think a minimum amount of comments and self-documented code is always sufficient, though most of the time it is! But sometimes there is a missing piece about why the decision was made, and even if the code is quite self-explanatory, the “why” cannot be guessed.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at this fake authentication method:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">authenticate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># We don't use has_secure_password here because we needed to maintain</span>
    <span class="c1"># compatibility with our legacy system that used a custom hashing algorithm.</span>
    <span class="c1"># This implementation ensures that both old and new passwords work during</span>
    <span class="c1"># the transition period. See migration plan in JIRA ticket AUTH-4592.</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kp">false</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">password_digest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">blank?</span>
    
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">password_digest</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">start_with?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'legacy:'</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="c1"># Legacy algorithm with different salt approach</span>

        <span class="c1"># Upgrade to bcrypt if login successful with legacy password</span>
        <span class="n">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">password: </span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">result</span>

      <span class="no">BCrypt</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Password</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password_digest</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">is_password?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The comment here tells us exactly <em>why</em> we’re not using Rails’ built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_secure_password</code>. Without this comment, someone might think “let’s refactor this to use the standard approach” and break compatibility with the legacy system. The comment gives us crucial insight that we’d never get just from the code!</p>

<p>Here’s another example on a possible payment system:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">PaymentProcessor</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">process_international_payment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">currency</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">recipient</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># Japanese yen amounts must be handled as whole numbers without decimal places</span>
    <span class="c1"># due to requirements from their banking API. One JPY in our system is sent as 1,</span>
    <span class="c1"># unlike other currencies where we send the amount in smallest unit (cents)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">currency</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upcase</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'JPY'</span>
      <span class="n">formatted_amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">amount</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_i</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="c1"># Convert from dollars to cents for other currencies</span>
      <span class="n">formatted_amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">amount</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_i</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    
    <span class="c1"># Stripe has a 25-second timeout for payments to Turkey (see outage report 2023-05-12)</span>
    <span class="c1"># so we increase our timeout and add retries only for this specific country</span>
    <span class="n">timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recipient</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">country_code</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">'TR'</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="mi">45</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">30</span>
    
    <span class="n">api_client</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create_payment</span><span class="p">(</span>
      <span class="ss">amount: </span><span class="n">formatted_amount</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="ss">currency: </span><span class="n">currency</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="ss">recipient: </span><span class="n">recipient</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="ss">request_timeout: </span><span class="n">timeout</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The comments explain business logic that isn’t obvious at all from the code. Without them, someone might try to “clean up” the code by standardizing the amount formatting or timeouts, and boom! You’ve got subtle bugs in production that are super hard to track down.</p>

<p>And if a new developer decides to refactor the code, which they should consider, they might think “why not use a <a href="https://github.com/RubyMoney/money">Money</a> gem to handle the details?” With these comments, they will have extra information to actually perform the best changes, and not just wait for a test to break or a fire to be put out.</p>

<p>Now look at this example, explaining exactly what a code should do, in steps where the code itself can already express these actions:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Order</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">calculate_total</span>
    <span class="c1"># Initialize the total variable to zero</span>

    <span class="c1"># Loop through each item in the order</span>
    <span class="n">order_items</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="c1"># Get the price of each item</span>
      <span class="n">item_price</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">price</span>
      
      <span class="c1"># Get the quantity of each item</span>
      <span class="n">quantity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">item</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">quantity</span>
      
      <span class="c1"># Multiply price by quantity to get item subtotal</span>
      <span class="n">item_subtotal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">item_price</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">quantity</span>
      
      <span class="c1"># Add the item subtotal to the total</span>
      <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="n">item_subtotal</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    
    <span class="c1"># If there is a discount, subtract it from the total</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">discount</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">present?</span>

      <span class="n">discount_amount</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">discount</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">amount</span>
      
      <span class="c1"># Subtract the discount from the total</span>
      <span class="n">total</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="n">discount_amount</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
    
    <span class="c1"># Return the final total</span>

    <span class="c1"># Return true only if payment is processed and items are available</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">payment_processed</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">items_available</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These comments in the last example do not help at all. This is especially true with Ruby, an eloquent language. Why explain if something is in stock when Ruby itself can express this clearly with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">item.in_stock?</code>?</p>

<p>These examples show exactly what I’m talking about — comments that go beyond just describing the code. They give us the backstory, the <em>why</em> behind decisions that we could never guess from the code alone. They reference things like historical constraints, API quirks, and business rules that aren’t apparent in the code itself. That’s the real value of good comments!</p>

<p>Now, comments should give context and answer questions that code cannot do. Explain the whys. Otherwise, your code should always be self-explanatory. This includes using good class names and methods that follow good principles and have good design. So you won’t over-engineer anything or add hundreds of bad comments.
Frameworks (such as Rails) have <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activesupport/lib/active_support/concern.rb">great examples</a> of comments that add context, explanations and lead you to a correct solution.</p>
